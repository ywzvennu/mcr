//! The wide variant trait: the generic analogue of the concrete
//! [`crate::variant::Variant`] for the large-board [`Geometry`] layer.
//!
//! Where the concrete [`Variant`](crate::variant::Variant) drives the frozen 8x8
//! [`crate::Position`], [`WideVariant`] drives a
//! [`GenericPosition<G, V>`](super::position::GenericPosition) over an arbitrary
//! [`Geometry`]. It is a zero-sized rule layer — every method has a sensible
//! default implementing **standard chess rules**, so a variant overrides only
//! the hooks it changes, exactly as the concrete trait does
//! (`docs/fairy-variants-architecture.md` §4, §5).
//!
//! The reference instantiation, [`StandardChess`], overrides nothing but the
//! starting array, proving the generic engine reproduces concrete 8x8 perft.
//! The fairy hooks (drops, regions, multi-royal sets) are present as reserved
//! no-ops so later phases extend the trait without churn.
