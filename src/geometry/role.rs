//! This is the parallel generic analogue of the concrete [`crate::Role`]: where
//! the frozen 8x8 path has exactly the six standard roles, the generic layer
//! needs headroom for the fairy pieces the Milestone 10 variants introduce (see
//! `docs/fairy-variants-architecture.md` §1). [`WideRole`] is purely an
//! *identity + index*: the role's **movement is not defined here** — a variant
//! supplies that later. All this type does is name the role, give it a stable
//! board/pocket array index, and map it to and from a FEN character.
//!
//! The set is deliberately open-ended: it starts with the standard six plus the
//! named fairy pieces the architecture census lists, and a small reserved range
//! at the end. It **grows as variants land** — adding a role is a matter of
//! extending the enum (and bumping [`WideRole::COUNT`]); nothing here bakes in a
